### Self-Study Edition for Developers

---

## Curriculum Overview & Learning Paths

This curriculum is structured into six levels, taking a developer from foundational knowledge to production-ready and specialist skills. You can follow the full path or choose a path that aligns with your career goals.

| Level | Focus | Core Skills |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Foundations** | TypeScript & Modern JS | Type safety, data modeling, ES2022+ features |
| **Beginner** | Vue 3 Composition API | Reactivity, components, props/emits, styling |
| **Intermediate** | SPA Architecture | Composables, routing, state management, slots |
| **Advanced** | Production Quality | Testing, performance optimization, advanced patterns |
| **Production** | Deployment & Operations | Build optimization, CI/CD, monitoring, PWA |
| **Specialist** | Advanced Architectures | SSR (Nuxt), real-time, micro-frontends |

#### Recommended Learning Paths:
*   **Full-Stack Vue Developer (12-16 weeks):** Foundations → Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Production
*   **Component Library Developer (10-12 weeks):** Foundations → Beginner → Intermediate → Specialist (Design Systems)
*   **Real-Time App Developer (10-12 weeks):** Foundations → Beginner → Advanced → Specialist (Real-Time)

## Self-Study Design Principles

*   **No instructor required:** All feedback is built into the exercises.
*   **Pattern-first, not theory-first:** Memorize → use → then understand the "why."
*   **Spaced repetition:** Old patterns are recycled in new contexts.
*   **Active recall:** Every section requires you to produce code.
*   **Realistic pressure simulation:** Timed drills and deadline scenarios.
*   **Self-diagnosis:** Identify your own weak patterns and adapt.
*   **Progress visibility:** Clear milestones and runnable code.
*   **Incremental complexity:** Each lesson builds predictably on the last.
*   **Real-world scenarios:** Patterns are tied to production situations.
*   **Multiple learning modes:** Code chunks, deep dives, diagrams, and exercises.
